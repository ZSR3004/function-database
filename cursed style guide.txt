Recursive Sequence Style Guide:

x refers to a variable; only use this variable
c is a constant, it can be replaced by any number
Do not include a(n), include only everything after the equals sign

Basic Operations:
Addition: +
Subtraction: -
Multiplication: *
Division: /
Factorials: factorial(c)

To refer to previous terms, use ().

For example, the term, a, before the nth term would be a(n-1).

Example:
The nth term is the second to last term added to the third to last term: a(n)=a(n-1)+a(n-2)

Degree:
Degree is determined by the farthest back term called.
For example, if you are adding the last and second to last term, then the sequence is to the second degree (degree of 2)
Look for the largest number you are subtracting n from.

Example: a(n-1)+a(n-2)*a(n-5); the largest number subtracting from n is 5, therefore this is to the fifth degree
